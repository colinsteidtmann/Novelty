# novelty

- A platform for contests to see who can create the most novel work (art, ideas, inventions...). Contest participants pay the set entrance fee that goes to the smart contract. Each participant gets 1 vote that they must give to a project that isn't theirs. When the contest ends, the smart contract allows the participant who received the most votes to claim the prize pool generated from the entrance fees.
